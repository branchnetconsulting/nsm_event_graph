This has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 running a standalone install of Security Onion.  It would likely work the same on a server install of Security Onion as well.

Get prerequisites:

Acquire AfterGlow 1.6.5 and put the afterglow.pl script in the system path.  This should work:
        wget http://pixlcloud.com/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=11 -O afterglow-1.6.5.tar.gz
        tar zxvf afterglow-1.6.5.tar.gz
        sudo cp afterglow/afterglow.pl /usr/bin/

Get and install the latest stable Graphviz.  The Ubuntu 12.04 package is too old, but Security Onion depends on it, so install from tarball in parellel to old version that is already present, like this:

        TARGET_GV_VER="2.38.0"
        wget http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/stable/SOURCES/graphviz-$TARGET_GV_VER.tar.gz
        tar zxvf graphviz-$TARGET_GV_VER.tar.gz
        cd graphviz-$TARGET_GV_VER
        ./configure && make && sudo make install

Get nsm_event_graph and move the script and config files to appropriate locations

        git clone https://github.com/branchnetconsulting/nsm_event_graph.git
        cd nsm_event_graph/
        mv /nsm_event_graph.pl /usr/bin/
        mv nsm_event_graph.* /usr/etc/


Usage example:    sudo nsm_event_graph.pl 24
       (builds an event graph ./graph.png based on the past 24 hours of events in Sguil,i
        according to the specifications of various config files in the local directory)
